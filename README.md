# 🌟 Game of Life 🌟

Welcome to the **Game of Life**, a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Conway. This project is an implementation of the game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Drawing Your Cells**

   - At the start, you'll see a grid of red-stroked squares.
   - Click on any square to activate your first cells. Activated cells will be highlighted.

2. **Starting the Game**

   - Once you’ve set up your initial configuration, press the **Space** button to start the game.
   - The game will iterate through generations, following the rules of Conway’s Game of Life.

3. **Pausing the Game**

   - To pause the game at any point, press the **Space** button again.

4. **Clearing the Board**
   - To clear the board and start over, press the **Backspace** button.

## 🌈 Features

- **Interactive Grid**: Click to activate cells and set up your initial configuration.
- **Responsive Controls**: Use the Space and Backspace buttons to control the game.
- **Real-Time Simulation**: Watch as your cells evolve according to the rules of the game.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **HTML**: Structure of the game.
- **CSS**: Styling of the grid and cells.
- **JavaScript**: Game logic and interaction handling.

## 📜 Rules of Conway's Game of Life

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies (underpopulation).
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies (overpopulation).
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell (reproduction).
